GradleBoot Values
-----------------

- Make mostly accurate assumptions about what the user is trying to do.
- Don't insinuate ourselves throughout the project
  - Our gradle stuff is hidden until you decide to leave the wonderful world of GradleBoot
  - `graboo goodbye` (ghosts itself and moves .graboo to .)
